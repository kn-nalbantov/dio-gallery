A simple web page for displaying pictures of eyewear frames


This is one of the first projects I completed when learning JavaScript. 
I got inspiration for it when working as a salesperson for eyewear company DIO, hence the name of the project.

The pictures of the frames which were distributed by Dio in Bulgaria can be found on the official website of the producer:
Area98 srl:

Localization update:
initially index.html was only available in Bulgarian so I used the idea for a php language switcher from the demo here:

and now index.php makes the web page available in 3 languages - Enlgish, Bulgarian and Italian.
